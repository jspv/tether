    """Integrity digest for a handle's bytes: ``"v2:"`` + sha256 over the file's length, its
    first ``_DIGEST_BYTES`` (64 KiB) and its last ``_DIGEST_BYTES``.

    **Coverage, exactly.** A file of 128 KiB or less is hashed *in its entirety*: an edit at
    any offset is detected. A larger file is covered by its length, its first 64 KiB and its
    last 64 KiB. A length-preserving edit to the **middle** of a file larger than 128 KiB
    (the bytes between offset 64 KiB and ``size - 64 KiB``) is **not detected**. This is not
    a whole-file integrity check.

    The tail is covered because a parquet footer -- the schema and row count the summary
    reports -- lives there, and the head alone left it unprotected.

    **Why not a whole-file hash.** The describers read only a bounded window so a
    multi-gigabyte handle can be described cheaply; hashing the whole file on every ``get()``
    would throw that away. The residual above is the stated price.

    **Boundary handling.** For ``size <= 2 * _DIGEST_BYTES`` the two windows would overlap
    or touch, so the file is read once, whole, and hashed once (no byte is hashed twice). For
    larger files the head and tail windows are disjoint, read with one seek on one open
    handle. The size is taken from that open handle, so the length hashed is the length read.

    **Format tag.** The ``v2:`` prefix distinguishes this from the earlier untagged
    (length + first 64 KiB) digests. A digest recorded in the old format therefore never
    equals a current one: it fails verification (a false failure) rather than passing
    (a false pass). Handle digests are re-derived on rehydrate, so this only affects a
    digest held across a code upgrade within one process.
