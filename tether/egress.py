"""Egress policy: the single place that decides whether a URL may be fetched.

The model chooses the URLs this project fetches, and fetched content is itself untrusted,
so egress is a model-controlled capability. This module denies the internal address space
and cloud instance-metadata endpoints by default. Metadata endpoints are checked
unconditionally and cannot be overridden by the allowlist.

When following redirects, guarded_get re-validates each hop against egress policy, because
httpx's redirect-following happens without consulting policy. Without this, a public URL
could 302 straight into the internal network or metadata endpoints.

Known residual risk: validation resolves the hostname and then hands the URL to httpx,
which resolves it again -- a DNS entry that changes in between (rebinding) is not caught.
Closing that needs connect-to-validated-IP with a Host override; see the spec's out-of-scope
section.
