"""Capability bundles: which tools each exposes and how to operate them.

The data substrate (handle store + spill + inspect_handle) is always-on CORE.
``code`` / ``files`` / ``web`` / ``deliver`` are opt-in layers (``deliver`` is only exposed when
the host configured an ``on_publish`` callback). Each contributes (a) tool names
and (b) a ``tether_instructions`` fragment the model reads to operate the tools.
