"""Publishing workspace files to the host: types and parent-side validation.

A publication request names a file in the session root, from the ``publish_file`` tool or from
``publish()`` inside sandboxed code. Either way the request is untrusted, so the parent
re-validates it here before the host callback ever sees it, and the model sees only metadata.

    No link is ever followed, so the answer never depends on the host filesystem (which would
    let sandboxed code probe it): the path is normalized lexically and must stay inside the
    root, then each component is ``lstat``-ed from the root down — every directory must be a
    real directory and the last component a regular file, and a symlink anywhere is refused.
    Internal trees and control files are refused; finally the file is opened with
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and size + digest are taken from that descriptor, so they describe the bytes
    that were actually checked.

    With ``snapshot_dir``, the checked bytes are also copied (from that same descriptor) into a
    file there, and ``PublishedFile.path`` points at the copy: the host then reads a private
    snapshot that sandboxed code cannot swap or modify, never the workspace path itself.
    Any path the OS cannot represent (NUL, lone surrogates) is a ``PublishError`` too.
