# Roadmap

Status of work beyond the shipped v0.1.1 surface. The README documents what exists;
this file tracks what doesn't yet. Per-item design specs and phased plans live in
`docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`.

Last reviewed: 2026-10-01.

## In progress

Nothing currently.

## Delivered

### Security hardening — make the trust boundary real
Delivered 2026-10-01; design in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-17-security-hardening-design.md`.
Zero-trust handle metadata (the parent derives every field from the bytes; handles are
immutable; the control channel is bounded), container backend by default, an egress guard
(`tether/egress.py`) covering `fetch_url` and `read_document`, and per-conversation tools via
`tool_factory`. Residuals are listed under Planned and Smaller carry-overs.

## Planned

### IP pinning (full DNS-rebinding closure)
The egress guard resolves a host to validate it and the HTTP client resolves it again, so a
DNS entry that changes in between is not caught. Closing it needs connect-to-validated-IP with
a Host override (custom transport, with TLS SNI care). Out of scope for the hardening phase;
the residual TOCTOU window is accepted.

### Control-plane relocation
Moving the sandbox control files out of the child-visible session root. Superseded for
security purposes by parent-side re-derivation of handle metadata; optional defence in depth.

### Streaming fetch bodies
`fetch_url` and `read_document` hold the whole response body in memory; `max_bytes` caps what
is *written*, not what is *held*. Fixing this needs a streaming `guarded_get` variant.

### Micro-VM sandbox tier
gVisor / Firecracker behind the existing `SandboxExecutor` interface, as a third `backend`
value alongside `local` and `container`. Sequenced after the hardening work, which has now made the
container tier the default.

### MAF skills + memory providers (v1.1)
Wire MAF's `Skill`/`SkillsProvider` and `MemoryStore`/`MemoryContextProvider` into the
harness so the agent can accumulate reusable procedures and cross-session memory. Both are
marked experimental upstream and emit `ExperimentalWarning`, so pin behavior carefully.

### Workflow durability / HITL outer shell
Wrap the agent loop in a MAF Workflow to get checkpointing, resume, and human-gated steps —
the durable outer orchestration that the original research reserved Workflows for, with the
single agent loop as a node inside it.

## Smaller carry-overs

Real but low-severity; each is a contained fix.

- **`read_file` has no binary-file handling** (`tools/files.py`) — a binary file decodes to
  replacement characters instead of returning a clear "this is binary, use a handle" signal.
- **`inspect_handle` calls `describe()` unguarded** (`tools/inspect.py:18`) — the shape is
  wrong for non-numeric frames, and it materializes the whole object to do it.
- **`max_file_size_mb` is silently ignored on the container tier** — now the default backend,
  so the config field does nothing by default. Documented as local-tier-only in the README;
  a container-side equivalent (or a warning when it is set) is still open.
- **Ruff scanned agent worktrees.** The tooling worktree directory is now excluded in
  `pyproject.toml`, so `ruff check .` no longer reports copies of the code. The remaining
  lint findings (unused imports, late imports in tests) are pre-existing and untouched.
- **`_OrchestratedSandbox` is sequential and not re-entrant per root** — fine at current
  scale; revisit if concurrent runs per conversation are ever needed.

## Explicitly out of scope

Decided, not deferred — revisit only with a concrete need.

- Headless-browser / JS rendering for fetches.
- A full search-provider abstraction (Tavily is the one provider).
- Alternative document backends (Docling is the one backend).

## Threat model

Decided 2026-06-15. **The model itself, and any content it pulls from the web or documents,
is treated as potentially adversarial.** Prompt-injection-in-fetched-content escalating to
code execution or SSRF is in scope. Consequences: the sandbox must be a real isolation
boundary, not a nominal one; egress is a model-controlled capability and must be filtered;
and per-conversation resources must not be shared. When touching sandbox, fetch, handles, or
conversation resource wiring, assume the model is an adversary whose capability set is the
tool surface.

Registry scope (in-process / single-event-loop vs. distributed) is **undecided**. Preserve
optionality: invest in the per-conversation lease, the clean async `ConversationStore` seam,
and bounded capacity — all valuable under either answer — and defer persistence and
distribution.
