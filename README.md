# tether

> A reusable Python substrate for building autonomous data-gathering and data-integration agents — a single-agent-loop ("coding agent") harness on the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) (MAF).

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12%2B-blue)
![Built on Microsoft Agent Framework](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20on-Microsoft%20Agent%20Framework-512BD4)

You give it a task and a set of tools (or MCP servers). It fetches data from links and tools, keeps large datasets **out of the model's context** as typed *handles*, and uses a **sandboxed Python environment** to write and run code that analyzes that data — returning a trustworthy answer plus a re-openable audit trail of every script and artifact.

This is **v1: the general substrate**. Specific problems plug in later as user-supplied tools / MCP servers.

## Key features

- **References, not payloads.** Large or structured returns from tools, MCP servers, and URLs spill to typed **handles** (JSON / text / Parquet) *before* they reach the model — ~200 tokens stand in for megabytes.
- **A computer for the agent.** A sandboxed `run_python` speaks the same handle store (`load(id)` / `save(id, obj)`), so the agent writes and runs code to do the real work; only what it deliberately returns flows back into context.
- **MAF-native.** Builds a standard MAF agent (`create_harness_agent`) you can run, stream, compose into workflows, or use as a sub-agent — with any MAF chat client (OpenAI by default; Azure, Foundry, or your own).
- **One-shot and continuous.** Ephemeral, self-cleaning `solve()` for one-shots; a persistent multi-turn `Conversation` (workspace + history) with an optional idle TTL for continuous use.
- **Tools and MCP, auto-handled.** Plain Python callables and MCP servers (stdio / HTTP / WebSocket) drop into one `tools=[…]` list; spill handling and server lifecycle are managed for you.
- **Live status.** Built-in, developer (`report_progress`), and MCP-server progress all stream through one `on_status` feed, `--verbose`, or AG-UI events.
- **AG-UI / CopilotKit.** Stream answer text, tool-call visibility, and status as AG-UI events; frontend tools, shared state, human-in-the-loop, and multi-turn history all work.
- **Confined by construction.** One session root holds everything; every model-supplied path passes through a single `safe_path` chokepoint, and the container sandbox tier (real isolation) is the default, and parent-side fetches are filtered against internal address space.

## How it works

The central design move is keeping large data out of context. When a tool, MCP server, or URL returns something big or structured, a **"spill" middleware** intercepts it *before it reaches the model* and writes it to disk as a typed **handle** (JSON, text, or a dataframe stored as Parquet). The model only ever sees a compact summary:

```json
{ "handle": "h1", "kind": "dataframe", "source": "query_sales(region='EU')",
  "schema": {"date": "date", "units": "int", "revenue": "float"},
  "n_rows": 480000, "n_cols": 3, "bytes": 18402211,
  "path": "handles/h1.parquet",
  "preview": "date,units,revenue\n2025-01-01,12,840.0\n... (5 of 480000 rows)" }
```

~200 tokens stand in for 18 MB. To actually work with the data, the agent is given a **computer**: it writes `.py` scripts and runs them in a sandbox that speaks the same handle store (`load(id)` / `save(id, obj)`). Only the small value it deliberately prints/returns flows back into context; derived data becomes new handles. The loop follows a **search → read → analyze** triad: `search` to locate, `read_file` to load the right slice, `run_python` to analyze.

## Getting started

### Installation

Requires **Python 3.12** and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). `agent-framework-core` is a prerelease, so allow prereleases when syncing:

```bash
uv sync --prerelease=allow
```

Optional extras:

```bash
uv sync --prerelease=allow --extra docling   # document ingestion (read_document)
uv sync --prerelease=allow --extra agui       # AG-UI / CopilotKit streaming
```

Document ingestion uses [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling), which downloads its models on first use. To pay that cost up front (e.g. at deploy time) instead of on the first `read_document` call, prefetch them:

```bash
tether-prefetch-docling          # add --ocr to also fetch OCR models (scanned documents)
```

OCR is **off by default** — born-digital PDFs/Office files get their tables and structure without it. Set `TetherConfig.documents.ocr = True` for scanned/image documents.

### API keys

Create a `.env` in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # required by the default OpenAI client (see "Bring your own model client" to use another provider)
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...      # optional — enables web_search / web_extract
```

### Quickstart: CLI

```bash
uv run tether "What is the total EU revenue in 2025, excluding invalid rows?"
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--model` | `gpt-5-mini` | Model for the built-in OpenAI client (reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `AZURE_OPENAI_*` for Azure routing). The CLI uses that client; for other providers drive the tether from Python with your own client — see [Bring your own model client](#bring-your-own-model-client) |
| `--root` | a fresh session dir | Workspace root (the confinement boundary) |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | off | Print live tool status to stderr as the task runs (see [Live status updates](#live-status-updates)) |

The CLI prints the answer and leaves `[session: …]` — the directory holding every script, handle, and artifact for inspection.

### Quickstart: library

```python
from tether import Tether, TetherConfig, solve

# One-shot convenience
result = solve("Summarize the latest figures from https://example.com/report.pdf")
print(result.final_text)

# Reusable tether with your own tools
def query_sales(region: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Return sales rows for a region."""
    ...

# With no client passed, the tether builds the default OpenAI client (reads OPENAI_API_KEY).
# `model` configures ONLY that default client — to use Azure / Foundry / any other provider,
# pass your own MAF chat client (see "Bring your own model client"); `model` is then ignored.
h = Tether(TetherConfig(model="gpt-5-mini"))
result = h.solve(
    "Total EU revenue in 2025, excluding invalid rows?",
    tools=[query_sales],          # plain Python callables; auto-wrapped + spill-handled
)

result.final_text   # the answer
result.handles      # dict of handle summaries produced during the run
result.files        # user-meaningful files written under the session root
result.session_dir  # full audit trail (scripts, handles, transcript)
result.error        # None, or a string if the run failed (e.g. context overflow)
```

Your tools are wrapped as MAF agent tools automatically, and their returns pass through the same spill middleware — so tool-produced and code-produced data are identical kinds of handle.

## Examples and samples

The quickstarts above and the guides below are each worked examples. Two runnable samples ship in the repo:

| Sample | Shows |
|---|---|
| [`examples/copilotkit/`](examples/copilotkit/) | **Full end-to-end app:** a CopilotKit chat UI + a FastAPI AG-UI backend with an **MCP server** wired in — ask a data question and watch the agent call the MCP tool, spill the result to a handle, and run sandboxed Python to answer |
| [`examples/agui_server.py`](examples/agui_server.py) | The minimal AG-UI backend: a FastAPI endpoint that streams a tether run as SSE |

## Guides

### Use it as a MAF agent

`solve()` and `Conversation` are conveniences over a plain Microsoft Agent Framework agent. When you want the agent **itself** — to drive it directly, stream it, give it a multi-turn thread, or drop it into a MAF workflow as a node/sub-agent — build it with `Session.create_agent()` and then use the ordinary MAF agent surface:

```python
import asyncio
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient
from tether import Session, TetherConfig

async def main():
    # The two-step (open a workspace, then build the agent over it) is the only tether-specific
    # part — it binds the agent to one session root + sandbox. The build call itself is standard MAF.
    async with Session.create(TetherConfig()) as session:
        agent = await session.create_agent(
            OpenAIChatClient(model="gpt-5-mini", env_file_path=".env"),
            agent_instructions="Reconcile EU sales and flag anomalies.",  # your task prompt
            tools=[query_sales, mcp],          # plain callables + MCPTools, spill-handled for you
            bundles=("code", "files", "web"),  # which built-in tool families to include
        )

        # `agent` is a MAF `Agent` — the usual interface, nothing tether-specific from here:
        reply = await agent.run("Which regions look anomalous?")
        print(reply.text)

        # Multi-turn over a MAF AgentSession (history threads across calls):
        thread = agent.create_session()
        await agent.run("Now compare against last quarter.", session=thread)

        # Streaming:
        async for update in agent.run("Summarize the findings.", stream=True):
            print(update.text, end="")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Because the returned object is a standard MAF `Agent`, it composes anywhere a MAF agent is expected — as a workflow node, a sub-agent, or behind the AG-UI wrapper (`agui_stream` does exactly this with `conv.agent`). Construction goes through MAF's own `create_harness_agent(client, …)` factory, so apart from the workspace two-step and the spill-wrapping of your tools, you are building and running an ordinary MAF agent.

### Bring your own model client

The convenience entry points (`solve`, `Tether(...)` with no `client`) use MAF's OpenAI client by default — following [MAF's own Python convention](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/blob/main/python/README.md) (`OPENAI_API_KEY` present → OpenAI). The tether is **not** OpenAI-only: it needs only an object implementing MAF's chat-client protocol (`SupportsChatGetResponse`), and never authenticates one for you when you supply it. The same client is reused across one-shots and every continuous conversation. Two injection points:

```python
# High-level facade — your client flows to solve / aopen / agui_stream
h = Tether(TetherConfig(), client=my_client)

# Composable path — pass it straight to create_agent
agent = await session.create_agent(my_client, agent_instructions="…", tools=[…])
```

MAF's `OpenAIChatClient` already does Azure routing. For Azure with a **refreshing token provider**:

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
from agent_framework.openai import OpenAIChatClient
from tether import Tether, TetherConfig

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(      # fresh bearer token per call → handles refresh
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")

client = OpenAIChatClient(
    azure_endpoint="https://my-resource.openai.azure.com",
    api_version="2024-10-21",
    credential=token_provider,
    model="my-gpt-5-deployment",                 # Azure deployment name
)
h = Tether(TetherConfig(), client=client)      # config.model is ignored; the client carries it
```

If you already hold a fully-built MAF chat client (your own custom-auth Azure / Foundry / OpenAI-compatible client), skip all of the above and just pass it: `Tether(TetherConfig(), client=that)`.

### Sessions: one-shot vs continuous

The tether serves both one-shot and continuous (multi-turn) interactions from any frontend.

- **One-shot** (`solve`) is ephemeral — it runs and **cleans up its workspace** when done. Pass `keep=True` to retain the audit trail (`result.session_dir`).
- **Continuous** keeps a persistent workspace (handles + sandbox files) and conversation history across turns, until you close it (or an optional idle TTL expires).

```python
import asyncio
from tether import Tether, TetherConfig

async def main():
    h = Tether(TetherConfig(idle_ttl_s=1800))     # idle conversations expire after 30 min (optional)
    conv = await h.aopen("thread-42")                # open or resume by id (e.g. an AG-UI threadId)
    print((await conv.aask("load sales.csv and summarize")).final_text)
    print((await conv.aask("now filter to EU")).final_text)   # sees the prior turn's handles + history
    await conv.aclose()                              # reap this conversation's workspace
    await h.aclose_sessions()                        # (host shutdown) close any remaining
    # await h.sweep_sessions()  # reap idle conversations on your own cadence

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Agent instructions.** Give the agent your domain system prompt with `agent_instructions` — on `Tether(...)` as the default for every conversation, or per conversation on `aopen(...)` (which wins when both are set); `solve`/`asolve` accept it too. MAF layers it *after* tether's operating manual: `<core + bundle instructions>`, a blank line, then `<agent_instructions>`. Leave tool mechanics to tether and put the data model, workflow, and conventions in yours. The per-conversation value applies when a conversation is created; re-opening a live id returns the existing agent.

```python
h = Tether(cfg, agent_instructions=SYSTEM_PROMPT)
conv = await h.aopen("thread-42", agent_instructions=OTHER_PROMPT)   # optional override
```

AG-UI hosts get this automatically — `agui_stream` maps each request's `threadId` to a persistent conversation, so handles and files persist across turns (history stays in the AG-UI message replay).

### Exchanging files with the user

**Delivering files.** Pass `on_publish` (on `Tether(...)`, or per conversation on `aopen`) and
select the `deliver` bundle. The model writes a file under `outputs/` and calls `publish_file`
(or `publish()` inside `run_python`, or `publish_handle` for a handle). Tether validates every
request in the parent — inside the root, a regular file and not a symlink, not under
`handles/` or `.scripts/` or a control file, at most `max_publish_bytes` — then calls your
callback with a `PublishedFile(path, rel_path, name, size, sha256, content_type, description,
source)`. `path` is a private snapshot outside the workspace, copied from the validated bytes;
copy it during the callback — it is deleted when the callback returns. Its return
value reaches the model under `"host"`; if it raises, the tool returns an error and the run
continues. The callback runs synchronously in the tool call's context (so your contextvars are
visible) but possibly on a worker thread — make it thread-safe. Sandbox `publish()` requests
are processed after the script exits cleanly. Both the tools and `publish()` require the
`deliver` bundle **and** a callback; without either, they are not available to the model.

```python
from tether import PublishedFile, Tether

def host_publish(pf: PublishedFile) -> dict:
    file_id = storage.copy_in(pf.path, name=pf.name, run=CURRENT_RUN.get())
    return {"file_id": file_id, "label": pf.name}

h = Tether(cfg, bundles=("code", "files", "deliver"), on_publish=host_publish)
```

**Receiving files.** Between turns, hand uploads to the conversation:

```python
handle = conv.add_input(upload_bytes, input_id=upload.id, name=upload.filename)
# or: await conv.aadd_input(...)   # waits for a running turn instead of raising
```

The file lands at `inputs/<input_id>/<name>` (read-only; mounted `:ro` in the container tier)
and becomes a `binary` handle — `load(id)` in `run_python` returns its path. It is idempotent by
`input_id`, survives a restart on the same root, is capped by `max_input_bytes`, and is
**never parsed in the host process** (the preview is name/size/type plus raw first lines for
text files). `conv.inputs` lists them. Note: `read_document` on an input parses it with Docling
**in the host process**; prefer reading uploads inside `run_python` when isolation matters.

### MCP servers

Pass a MAF `MCPTool` — stdio, Streamable-HTTP, or WebSocket — in the same `tools=[…]` list. The tether connects each server, **owns its lifecycle** (closing it when the run ends, even on error), and attaches the same spill handling to every tool the server exposes — so a large MCP return (a long message list, a big query result) lands as a clean typed handle instead of flooding context.

```python
from agent_framework import MCPStdioTool
from tether import Tether, TetherConfig

# A stdio MCP server, launched however your other MCP clients launch it.
# (If the server resolves its config/credentials relative to a directory, launch it
#  from there, e.g. command="sh", args=["-c", "cd /path/to/server && exec uv run its-cmd"].)
mcp = MCPStdioTool(name="msgraph", command="uv", args=["run", "msgraph-mcp"])

h = Tether(TetherConfig(model="gpt-5-mini"))
result = h.solve("List the subjects of my 5 most recent emails.", tools=[mcp])
print(result.final_text)
```

A remote server works the same way:

```python
from agent_framework import MCPStreamableHTTPTool

mcp = MCPStreamableHTTPTool(
    name="my-service",
    url="https://example.com/mcp",
    header_provider=lambda _: {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},  # if it needs auth
)
result = h.solve("…", tools=[mcp])
```

MCP support needs the `mcp` SDK, which is a declared dependency, so `uv sync` already installs it.

**Serving many conversations: `tool_factory`.** A single live `MCPTool` is fine for one run, but it is owned and closed by whichever session finishes first, and every conversation would share its connection. For a host serving many conversations (AG-UI, CopilotKit), wrap the construction so each conversation builds and connects its own server:

```python
from tether import Tether, tool_factory
from agent_framework import MCPStdioTool

h = Tether(tools=[tool_factory(lambda: MCPStdioTool(name="msgraph", command="uv",
                                                    args=["run", "msgraph-mcp"]))])
```

`tool_factory` takes a zero-argument callable; it is called once per conversation. Only MCP-shaped objects are cleaned up on teardown: a session recognizes them by duck-typing on `connect`, `close`, and `.functions`, and closes the ones it connected. If your factory returns some other stateful object (a database client, say), the tether will not close it — manage its lifecycle yourself.

**On result size.** Spilling is lossless — a large page is preserved whole as a handle, so an MCP server's pagination cursor survives and the agent can fetch the next page. The two ends of the spill-over zone are configurable (`spill_threshold_bytes` … `max_spill_bytes`): a well-behaved server that paginates returns bounded pages that flow through cleanly, while an unbounded dump past `max_spill_bytes` raises `SpillLimitExceeded` rather than silently filling disk — nudging the source toward server-side pagination/filtering.

### Live status updates

Tools report progress while they run, and you receive it through an `on_status` callback — from the built-in tools, from your own tools (via `report_progress`), and from MCP servers (their logging and progress notifications are captured automatically).

```python
from tether import Tether, report_progress

def crunch(n: int) -> str:
    """Your tool can report progress."""
    for i in range(n):
        report_progress(f"processed {i + 1}/{n}", current=i + 1, total=n, tool="crunch")
    return "done"

def show(event):
    bar = f" [{event.current}/{event.total}]" if event.current is not None else ""
    print(f"→ {event.tool}: {event.message}{bar}")

Tether(tools=[crunch], on_status=show).solve("crunch 5 items")
```

The CLI exposes the same feed with `-v`/`--verbose` (printed to stderr). MCP-server status needs no extra wiring — a server's `notifications/message` arrive tagged `mcp:<server>`, and its `notifications/progress` arrive tagged with the calling tool's name plus `current`/`total`.

### AG-UI and CopilotKit

A tether run can drive an [AG-UI](https://docs.ag-ui.com/) client such as [CopilotKit](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/) — streamed answer text, live tool-call visibility, and the status feed above — all as AG-UI events. Install the optional extra:

```bash
uv sync --prerelease=allow --extra agui
```

`Tether.agui_stream(input_data)` yields AG-UI events for one request; encode them as SSE from your endpoint:

```python
from ag_ui.encoder import EventEncoder
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
from tether import Tether

app, tether = FastAPI(), Tether()

@app.post("/agent")
async def agent(request: Request):
    input_data = await request.json()                 # AG-UI RunAgentInput
    encoder = EventEncoder()
    async def sse():
        async for event in tether.agui_stream(input_data):
            yield encoder.encode(event)
    return StreamingResponse(sse(), media_type="text/event-stream")
```

Point your AG-UI client at this endpoint. The tether reuses the official `agent-framework-ag-ui` converter, so **frontend/generative-UI tools** (defined in the request), **shared state** (`state_schema`/`predict_state_config`, forwarded as keyword args to `agui_stream`), **human-in-the-loop**, and **multi-turn history** all work — with the tether's own progress feed overlaid as `tether.status` `CUSTOM` events. A runnable version is in [`examples/agui_server.py`](examples/agui_server.py).

## Reference

### Tool surface

The agent gets a small, fixed set of root-confined tools (listed below; the web and document tools activate when their key/extra is present). Domain data sources are *your* tools/MCP servers, auto-handled by spill.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `write_file(path, content)` | Write a file (root-jailed) |
| `read_file(path, offset=0, limit=2000)` | Bounded, paginated text |
| `list_files(path=".")` | Directory listing |
| `search(pattern, …)` | ripgrep over files/handles, with a Python-regex fallback |
| `run_python(code=None, path=None, args=[])` | Run a script in the sandbox → `{stdout, result, error, exit_code, new_handles}` |
| `fetch_url(url)` | Fetch a URL → typed handle; HTML is cleaned to Markdown (trafilatura) |
| `inspect_handle(id, …)` | Deeper on-demand look at a handle (fuller schema, more preview, optional stats) |
| `web_search(query, max_results=5)` | Tavily web search (needs `TAVILY_API_KEY`) |
| `web_extract(url)` | Tavily clean-content extraction (needs `TAVILY_API_KEY`) |
| `read_document(source)` | A workspace path or URL → clean markdown handle (tables preserved) via Docling; needs the `docling` extra |
| `publish_file(path, name=None, description=None)` | Deliver a workspace file to the host (`deliver` bundle; only with `on_publish`) |
| `publish_handle(handle_id, format=None, name=None)` | Deliver a handle as csv/xlsx/parquet/json (`deliver` bundle; only with `on_publish`) |

### Security and confinement

Every session has one **root directory**; everything — handles, agent-written scripts, reads/writes, the sandbox `cwd` — lives under it.

- **Layer 1 — Tool path-jail (guaranteed).** All model-supplied paths route through one chokepoint, `safe_path(root, p)`, which resolves symlinks *before* checking and rejects any path outside the root (blocks `..`, absolute paths, symlink escapes). It's the most heavily tested code in the project.
- **Layer 2 — Executed code.** `run_python` runs in the **container** tier by default: a hardened Podman/Docker container (network off, read-only root filesystem, dropped capabilities, non-root, memory/cpu/pid limits) — see [Sandbox tiers](#sandbox-tiers). If no usable container runtime is present, building the sandbox is a hard error (`SandboxRuntimeUnavailable`) that names the `local` opt-out; it never falls back silently. **The `local` tier is not a security boundary**: the code runs as the host user, with that user's file and network access, in a scrubbed-env subprocess with `resource` rlimits and a wall-clock timeout. Use it only when you have chosen that deliberately. A host that must not be able to opt out sets `SandboxConfig.require_isolation=True`, which refuses the local tier however it was selected — see [Sandbox tiers](#sandbox-tiers).
- **Layer 3 — Egress.** The model chooses the URLs the harness fetches, so egress is filtered. `fetch_url` and `read_document(url)` deny loopback, private, link-local, reserved, multicast and unspecified addresses by default, plus `100.64.0.0/10` (RFC 6598 carrier-grade NAT), which no standard `ipaddress` flag reports as private and so is denied explicitly. The harness follows redirects itself (`follow_redirects=False` is forced on every request), so **every hop is re-validated**. `read_document` downloads through the same guard and hands Docling a local path, never a URL, so Docling cannot follow its own redirects outside policy. To reach an internal data source, name it in `FetchConfig.allow_private_hosts` (hostnames or CIDRs).
  - **Cloud metadata endpoints are denied unconditionally and cannot be allowlisted.** `allow_private_hosts` cannot open them, by design: `169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `168.63.129.16`, `100.100.100.200`, `192.0.0.192` and `fd00:ec2::254`. Note `168.63.129.16` (Azure's wireserver) is a *public* address that nothing else would block; Azure users should expect it to be refused.
  - Known residual: the host is resolved for validation and then resolved again by the HTTP client, so a DNS-rebinding race is not closed (IP pinning is on the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)). `web_search` / `web_extract` call a fixed Tavily endpoint and are not filtered; an MCP server you install makes its own network calls, which the harness cannot filter.
- **Handle integrity.** Metadata the model sees for a handle (schema, row count, preview) is derived by the harness from the bytes on disk **when the handle is created**, never reported by the sandboxed code that wrote them — and it is re-derived, not believed, when a manifest is rehydrated onto a root that outlived its process. The handle **record** is immutable: adopting an existing id is refused and reported, so a script cannot describe its output falsely or repoint an existing handle. The **bytes** are not immutable — the session root is bind-mounted rw, so sandboxed code can overwrite a handle's file — so a content digest is recorded when the metadata is derived and checked on every read; a mismatch raises `HandleTamperedError` rather than returning data the summary no longer describes. The digest (sha256, version-tagged) covers the file's length, its first 64 KiB and its last 64 KiB (a parquet footer, which holds the schema and row count, lives at the tail). A file of 128 KiB or less is therefore hashed in full, but for a larger file a length-preserving edit to the middle (between the first and last 64 KiB) is **not detected** — this is not a whole-file integrity check, a trade-off that keeps describing and reading a multi-gigabyte handle cheap. The parent↔sandbox control channel is bounded (1 MiB emit payload, 8 MiB control file, 256 new handles per run; see the configuration table).
- **Tool isolation.** Wrap stateful tools such as MCP servers in `tool_factory` so each conversation gets its own instance (see [MCP servers](#mcp-servers)).

> The **container tier** is the default and provides real isolation. Select `local` explicitly with `TetherConfig.sandbox.backend = "local"` (or `TETHER_SANDBOX_BACKEND=local`) to opt out; both sit behind the same `SandboxExecutor` interface.

### Sandbox tiers

`run_python` executes model-authored code; two backends are chosen by `TetherConfig.sandbox.backend`. **`container` is the default**; `local` is an explicit opt-out.

- **`container`** (default) — runs the code in a hardened OCI container (Podman preferred, Docker supported; auto-detected). Network **off by default**, read-only root filesystem, `--cap-drop ALL`, non-root, and memory/cpu/pid limits. The session root is bind-mounted to `/workspace`, so handles round-trip exactly as in the local tier. If no usable runtime is found (a binary on `PATH` is not enough — the check probes liveness with `<runtime> info`), building the sandbox raises `SandboxRuntimeUnavailable`, with a message naming the `local` opt-out.
- **`local`** (explicit opt-out) — a scrubbed-env subprocess with `resource` rlimits, a wall-clock timeout, and the path-jail. Fast, no dependencies, but **no isolation**: the code runs as the host user and can read or write anything that user can, and use the network. Selecting it emits `NoSandboxIsolationWarning`; filter it with `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=tether.NoSandboxIsolationWarning)` once you have decided deliberately (CI, tests).

```python
from tether import Tether, TetherConfig
from tether.config import SandboxConfig

cfg = TetherConfig(sandbox=SandboxConfig(
    backend="container",           # the default; "local" opts out of isolation
    network=False,                 # opt-in with True if sandbox code must reach the network
    pip_packages=("rich",),        # provisioned into a mounted layer (network only during provisioning)
))
Tether(cfg).solve("…")
```

**Requiring isolation.** The container tier is already the default, so `require_isolation=True` is the stricter assertion on top of it: it refuses the local tier *however it was selected* — an explicit `backend="local"`, or `TETHER_SANDBOX_BACKEND=local` in the environment — with `SandboxRuntimeUnavailable` at `Session.create`, not on first use. A missing runtime or image raises; tether never falls back to the local tier. Set it on any host where no deployment mistake may quietly turn isolation off.

**Image readiness.** Runtime liveness and image readiness are different questions. Selecting the container tier probes the runtime with `<runtime> info` and raises `SandboxRuntimeUnavailable` if it is absent or not responding; whether the *image* is built is checked separately. By default the image (Python + `preinstalled` libraries) and any `pip_packages` layer are **built on first use** and cached — which, with `container` as the default backend, is what an out-of-the-box run does. `build_on_demand` controls this; its default (`None`) means "build unless `require_isolation`", so a host that demands isolation is also required to pre-build rather than discover a build on the first request. With builds disabled, a missing image makes `run_python` fail immediately with `SandboxImageMissing`, naming the exact command to run. Builds that do run are bounded by `build_timeout_s` (`SandboxImageError` on expiry); it is one
budget for the image build and the pip layer together. A timed-out pip-layer container is
removed, but a timed-out image build may finish in the runtime's background. Pre-build exactly what a host will ask for, and gate startup on a non-mutating preflight:

```bash
tether-build-sandbox --preinstalled pandas pyarrow numpy httpx --pip rich   # build image + layer
tether-build-sandbox --pip rich --check                                    # report only; exit 1 on problems
```

```python
from tether import sandbox_preflight
from tether.config import SandboxConfig

cfg = SandboxConfig(backend="container", require_isolation=True)   # build_on_demand -> False
report = sandbox_preflight(cfg)        # never builds; `image inspect` is time-bounded
if not report.ok:
    raise RuntimeError("; ".join(report.problems))
```

Notes: on macOS the runtime runs in a Linux VM, so the session root must sit under a VM-shared path (the default `~/.tether/...` is); the container tier does not enforce `max_file_size_mb` (memory/pid/cpu/network are enforced instead). The explicit `network=True` option exposes the container to the network; the egress guard applies to the harness's own fetches, not to code running in the sandbox.

### Configuration

`TetherConfig` (see `tether/config.py`) is a plain dataclass:

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | `"gpt-5-mini"` | Used only by the built-in OpenAI client; ignored when you inject a `client` |
| `spill_threshold_bytes` | `8192` | Lower edge of the spill-over zone: a tool return over this becomes a handle |
| `max_spill_bytes` | `100 MiB` | Upper edge: a return larger than this is **rejected loudly** (`SpillLimitExceeded`), never silently stored |
| `max_context_window_tokens` | `128_000` | Fed to MAF compaction |
| `max_output_tokens` | `4096` | |
| `root_dir` | `None` | `None` → a session dir under `./.tether/sessions/` |
| `idle_ttl_s` | `None` | Continuous-session idle TTL; `None` → never expire |
| `max_publish_bytes` | `100 MiB` | Largest file `publish_file` / `publish()` will deliver |
| `max_input_bytes` | `100 MiB` | Largest upload `add_input` will accept |
| `sandbox` | `SandboxConfig()` | `backend` (`container` by default; `local` = no isolation), `container_runtime`, timeout, limits, network, `pip_packages`, preinstalled libs, `require_isolation` (`False` — refuses a non-container backend however it was selected), `build_on_demand` (`None` → build unless isolation is required), `build_timeout_s` (`900`). **`max_file_size_mb` is enforced by the `local` tier only** — under the default `container` backend it has no effect (memory/cpu/pid limits and the network setting apply instead) |
| `fetch` | `FetchConfig()` | `max_bytes`, timeout, allowed URL schemes |
| `fetch.allow_private_hosts` | `()` | Hostnames or CIDRs exempted from the internal-address denylist, for internal data sources. Cloud metadata endpoints cannot be allowlisted |
| `fetch.max_redirects` | `5` | Redirect hops followed (each re-validated); more raises an error |
| `max_emit_bytes` | `1 MiB` | Cap on a sandbox emit payload, checked before parsing |
| `max_control_bytes` | `8 MiB` | Read cap on the sandbox's new-handles control file |
| `max_new_handles` | `256` | Handle records adopted per `run_python` call |
| `search` | `SearchConfig()` | Tavily provider, key, `max_results` |
| `documents` | `DocumentConfig()` | Docling ingestion: `ocr` (off by default) |

**`TETHER_SANDBOX_BACKEND`.** An environment variable that overrides the default of `SandboxConfig.backend`. It selects the **tier** (`container` or `local`), *not* the container runtime — use `SandboxConfig.container_runtime` to choose podman or docker. Setting it to `local` opts out of isolation; that is intended for CI and test environments that have made the choice deliberately. An explicit `SandboxConfig(backend=...)` always wins over the variable. Any value other than exactly `local` or `container` is an error (`ValueError`), not a silent fallback.

## Development

```bash
uv run pytest          # full suite — no network or API keys required
uv run ruff check .
```

Testing is a first-class principle: **tests are written before implementation for every unit** (TDD). The fast suite runs deterministically against a stub chat client (no API cost); live tests are gated behind `TETHER_LIVE=1`. `safe_path` and the spill logic are held to the highest bar.

Design specs and phased implementation plans for each feature live under [`docs/superpowers/`](docs/superpowers/).

## Roadmap

**Implemented:** foundation (handles, sandbox, path-jail); the agent loop + tool surface; the `Tether`/`solve()` API + CLI; web research (Tavily search/extract, Markdown fetch); **document ingestion** (`read_document` via Docling — PDF/spreadsheet → Markdown with tables); **live status updates** (built-in, developer, and MCP tools → an `on_status` feed / `--verbose`); an **AG-UI / CopilotKit** integration (`Tether.agui_stream`); a **container sandbox tier** (hardened Podman/Docker isolation behind `SandboxExecutor`); and a **session lifecycle** model (ephemeral one-shot `solve`; persistent continuous `aopen`/`aask`/`aclose` with optional idle TTL).

The **security-hardening phase** (zero-trust handle metadata, container-by-default, egress guard, per-conversation tools) is delivered; see [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for residuals.

**Planned** (documented under [`docs/superpowers/`](docs/superpowers/)):

- **Micro-VM sandbox tier** — gVisor / Firecracker, behind the same `SandboxExecutor` interface.
- **MAF skills + memory providers** (v1.1) and a MAF Workflow durability / HITL outer shell.

**Out of scope for now:** headless-browser/JS rendering, a full search-provider abstraction, and alternative document backends.
